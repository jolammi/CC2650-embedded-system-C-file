Our course work's goal was to make an application for the SensorTag where the user can play a car game where they must dodge or jump over obstacles that are sent to the device by a server. The user also had to have  an option to re-calibrate the device to use their own position preferences for  the moving and jumping.
The course work was done in Texas Instruments' TI Cloud Tools using CCS Cloud.
The .c file contains a lot of ready code provided for us by the couse staff. The main_menu, calibration and gaming functions are fully written by us. We have also made a lot of midifications to the ready code we were provided.
The course work taught us the following things about embedded devices:
- Pin configurations 
-State machine 
- Use of tasks
-Wireless data transfering
- Use of I2C 
- Use of CC2650's gyrosensor, temperature sensor and screen
